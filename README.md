# Upper-Nuovartica

Facts about Upper Nuovartica: 
The White Tower is located in the heart of Upper Nuovartica, a city that emerged from the ruins of Old Artica City after the Mass Disruption. Situated on a vast, elevated plateau, the tower is surrounded by a modern urban landscape that reflects the city's commitment to technological innovation and architectural prowess. The city's layout is designed to emphasize the central role of the White Tower, with radial streets and boulevards converging towards the tower, making it a focal point of the urban skyline.

Upper Nuovartica is bordered by the Great Wall and an impenetrable Fortress, protecting the city from the harsh wilderness. These boundaries instill a sense of security and isolation among the citizens, who remain largely unaware of the struggling tribes and communities outside their city.

The area surrounding the White Tower is a bustling metropolis with a diverse array of residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. Public parks, plazas, and green spaces provide residents with areas to relax and socialize. At the same time, cutting-edge research facilities, educational institutions, and cultural centers contribute to the city's status as a hub of knowledge and innovation.

In contrast to the thriving cityscape, the wilderness beyond Upper Nuovartica's walls is a desolate and inhospitable landscape. The nameless desert wasteland serves as a stark reminder of the devastation caused by the Mass Disruption and as a penal colony for the city's most dangerous criminals. The contrast between the flourishing city and the barren wilderness highlights the determination and resourcefulness of the citizens of Upper Nuovartica, who have managed to create a thriving society in the aftermath of global catastrophe.
Upper Nuovartica is the shining example of humanity's potential in the FoA universe. Rising from the ashes of Old Artica City after the "Mass Disruption," the Restoration Party set out to "elevate humanity" by creating a system where the Upper class of Nuovartica could build their unique communities on platforms in the "White Tower."

The citizens of Upper Nuovartica are proud of their resilience and accomplishments. They firmly believe they are the last remaining civilized society, having survived the devastation that brought the world to its knees. Their conviction is strengthened by the towering walls and the impenetrable Fortress that separate them from the harsh wilderness beyond.

Due to the extensive propaganda and isolation, the people of Upper Nuovartica are unaware of the struggling tribes that populate the desolate landscape outside their boundaries. They believe it is impossible to survive beyond the safety of the Great Wall and the wilderness surrounding the Fortress, unaware of the resourcefulness and determination of those who have defied the odds.

In Upper Nuovartica, citizens learn crucial information about governance and organization from professionals such as cops, social scientists, and other citizens. Tackling complex design challenges lets them unlock access to off-limit resources and knowledge under the Restoration Party's watchful eye.
Meanwhile, some daring individuals venture into "Lower Nuovartica," where a Dark Market and a cyberpunk community await.

In the wilderness beyond the city's boundaries lies a nameless desert wasteland, a place so inhospitable that even the hardiest of humans cannot survive. This desolate region serves as a penal colony for Upper Nuovartica's most dangerous criminals, who are exiled to face the unforgiving landscape as punishment for their transgressions. The road to this isolated hell is fraught with peril, and even the strongest individuals must confront their own mortality in this harsh environment.

Upper Nuovartica showcases the best of human ingenuity, with cutting-edge tech constructing the towering city zones. Citizens learn about governance and organization by interacting with one another and solving problems in science, math, tech, and engineering.

The once-thriving Old City of Humanity is now in ruins, with a few people still living there. New cities emerge alongside the old, forming layers above the remnants of the old world. A massive tower has been built using advanced tech, offering infinite possibilities for its residents. Each floor is a world of its own, with unique rules set by the owner.

With equal access to technology, concepts of wealth, poverty, and class begin to blur, and in the not-so-distant future, they might disappear entirely. People no longer need to work to achieve their dreams; luxury is within reach on their own floor, letting them experience lives that were once thought to be unattainable. However, as the citizens of Upper Nuovartica continue to revel in their perceived superiority, they remain oblivious to the thriving communities that persist beyond their walls, challenging the very foundations of their beliefs.
